Dlg4   10090.ENSMUSP00000018700        Disks large homolog 4; Interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of NMDA receptor subunits and shaker-type potassium channels. Required for synaptic plasticity associated with NMDA receptor signaling. Overexpression or depletion of DLG4 changes the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synapses in hippocampal neurons. May reduce the amplitude of ASIC3 acid-evoked currents by retaining the channel intracellularly. May regulate the intracellular trafficking of ADR1B; Belongs to the MAGUK family Dlg4   10090.ENSMUSP00000018700        Disks large homolog 4; Interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of NMDA receptor subunits and shaker-type potassium channels.
